# Bridge Bias 1.3

One more look at using docker in docker.

We'll see about them distributions. . .
. . . and they're better.
Perhaps there's something off with the xl170's networking stacks?

# Notes

Still observing different bias in emulated (DinD) setup.
The fraction is tantalizingly constant though so perhaps this should be
followed up on still.
