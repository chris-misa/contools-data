# First host networking mode experiment

See if there is any bias in a host-networked container.

Run 8/3 on utah.cloudlab.us

Both nodes were xl170 servers.

See file for more detail.

# Notes

8/4:

This data is odd. It is clearly bi- if not tri-modal
as the progressive analysis shows.


Also, despite the fact that the container is using the host's
network stack directly (?) there is still some bias sometimes.
